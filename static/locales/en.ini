priv-text.innerHTML = <p>One of the motives for creating Diskuti was to build a mailing list service that will keep a minimum amount of (meta)data and only the bare minimum that is required for its core functionality, in respect to users privacy.</p><p>Therefor we don't keep list archives. We also don't keep any access logs, either for emails or for this website.</p>
